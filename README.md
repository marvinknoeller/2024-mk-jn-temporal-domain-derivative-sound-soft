You find all the needed Matlab files in the provided project.

## An overview

To obtain the plots in the numerical examples use

## Requirements and additional information

The simulations have been carried out on clusters using 32, 64 or 128 cores.
Computations have been carried out using the Matlab 2021a version.
Running one simulation takes 1-2 days. 
The number of time steps and points in space may be decreased, what decreases the compuational time significantly.
